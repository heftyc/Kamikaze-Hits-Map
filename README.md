# Kamikaze Hits Map

This project aims to create a map documenting every kamikaze hit on allied ships. The data for the map comes from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Allied_vessels_struck_by_Japanese_special_attack_weapons) with a great deal of additional research done to improve the accuracy of the records. The map is built with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and React. It is currently still being developed and should be hosted on a website in the near future.
